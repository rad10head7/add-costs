# add-costs
a small python app for adding newlline in a text file. usefull for accounting

USE:
say you have to add a bunch of arbitrary numbers you have just accumulated. As long as each number is on a seperate line, you can save the file in your home directory and run the script it will prompt you what to do. take int and float.

PULLS:
I am busy but would welcome input on my next addition, to allow the file to be in any directory and the script automatically detect the working directory you are in running the script.
